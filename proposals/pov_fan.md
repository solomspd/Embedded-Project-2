# Persistance of vision fan display
A novel approach to creating images is through a Persistance Of Vision (POV) fan display.

Essentially, it is a fixture of a platform mounted on a motor that spins at high speeds so that you can no longer see the individual LED lights.
Then, the LEDs would light up at certain intervals so that it fools the human eye into thinking there is 1 cohesive image.

Beyond this base functionality, there can be a webpage that allows a user to input a string of text or perhaps even an image that will be correctly processed and displayed on the POV display.
